# Typing

### Purpose

As a developer, you will be spending a lot of time on the keyboard. Getting comfortable typing quickly will improve your productivity.

### Goals:

- **40+ wpm** - Make sure that you are touch-typing regular text at least 40 wpm and shoot for 50+.
- **20 wpm in code** - You'll be coding along and pair programming quite a bit in class, so this is essential in not falling behind.

### Resources:

- [10 Fast Fingers](http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english) Regular touch-typing (not looking at your fingers)
- [Typing.io](http://typing.io/lessons) These exercises are to help you get comfortable typing those awkward programming characters.  Work through the following tracks: JavaScript jQuery, Ruby on Rails, Less Bootstrap, and Shell Git
