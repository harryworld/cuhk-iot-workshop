## Computer Basics

Before we dive into programming, make sure you know your way around your computer like a developer. Your computer is now a tool of your trade.

Try to incorporate keyboard shortcuts into your day-to-day computer use. They may be awkward at first, but learning them will make you exponentially faster. So skip the mouse and use the keyboard shortcuts. Use them enough times and they become muscle memory.

Learning to use your computer efficiently and typing quickly are the **MOST CRITICAL** parts of the prework.
