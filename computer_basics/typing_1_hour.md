# Typing (1 hour)

Learn to type quickly. It will be a major hindrance in your productivity and ability to keep up during lectures, codealongs, labs, and group projects. Come back to this section to practice even as you move onto other sections.

###Resources:

- [10 Fast Fingers](http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english) Regular touch-typing (not looking at your fingers)
- [Typing.io](http://typing.io/lessons) These exercises are to help you get comfortable typing those awkward programming characters.  Work through the following tracks: JavaScript jQuery, Ruby on Rails, Less Bootstrap, and Shell Git

###Assess Yourself:

- **40+ wpm** - Make sure that you are touch-typing regular text at least 40 wpm and shoot for 50+.
- **20 wpm in code** - You'll be coding along and pair programming quite a bit in class, so this is essential in not falling behind.
