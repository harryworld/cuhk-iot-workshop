## Beautiful Code

Writing code that is beautiful is important. Why? Well let's first define what beautiful code is.

Beautiful code is:

1. Readable
2. Maintainable
3. Concise

You will hear us harp on proper indentation and choices of words. The intention is not to make life difficult for everyone, but rather to build up good habits.

Coding, once you understand the basics is not difficult. But as a project grows, keeping things understandable and maintainable becomes the real challenge.

As an analogy, everyone can write an English essay once they learn the language. The ultimate goal should not be to simply write an essay, but to eventually write like [Hemingway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway).
