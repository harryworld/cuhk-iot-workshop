## Beautiful Code

You will hear us say, _"writing beautiful code is important!"_ Why? Well let's first define what beautiful code is.

##### Beautiful code is:

1. Readable
2. Maintainable
3. Concise

You will hear us harp on proper indentation and choices of words and names. The intention is not to make life difficult for you, but rather to build up good habits.

Coding, once you understand the basics is not difficult. But as a project grows, keeping things understandable and maintainable becomes the real challenge.

Writing code is like writing a good essay or story. Everyone can write an essay once they learn the language. Ultimately, to be a master developer, you want to write like [Hemingway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway).
