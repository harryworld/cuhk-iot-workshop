## Mindset

Learning anything successfully requires a good mindset. Here are a few things to watch out for:

#### There is no magic in learning.

You get what you put into the course.

#### No one knows everything.

That includes your instructors. However, with the right experience and skillset, we can figure things out.

#### Development is an art.

As the saying goes, _"there are many was to skin a cat."_ So keep an open mind and exposing yourself to different ways people approach things. It will only help you grow.
