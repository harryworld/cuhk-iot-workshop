## Mindset

Learning anything successfully requires a good mindset. Here are a few things to watch out for:

#### There is no magic in learning.

At least no magic until the day we can transfer knowledge, _a la Matrix_, by plugging in a chip into your brain.

For now, you get what you put into the course.

#### No one knows everything.

That includes your instructors. We are not high and mighty.

What we do have are experience, skill sets, and connections to help us figure things out.

#### Development is an art.

The saying goes, _"There are many was to skin a cat."_

Keep an open mind and expose yourself to different ways people approach problems.

It will help you grow as a developer much quicker.
