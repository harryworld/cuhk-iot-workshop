## Oh-My-ZSH

### Purposes

```Your terminal never felt __this__ good before.```

This is what described by Oh-My-Zsh. A lot of people think that developers are boring, but actually we are NOT. We love beautiful things, we love to make everything effective, and want to live our life better.

`Oh-My-Zsh` is the tool to help make our boring Terminal look a lot better. You could even customize the colors, the behaviour and the add-ons to be used. By default, there are over 120 themes for you to choose.

### Steps

1. Look at the documentation in [GitHub](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
2. Launch `iTerm`, and type in command `curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh`
3. Turn off `iTerm` by `Command + Q`, and restart

### Goals

- You will see colors for the commands in your `iTerm`
