## HTML Notes

###The Grammar of HTML Elements

- Starts with a start tag (e.g. `<p>`)
- End with an end tag (e.g. `</p>`)
- Elements content is everything between the start and end tags
- Some elements have empty content, as a place holder (e.g. `<div id="content"></div>`)
- Most elements have attributes
