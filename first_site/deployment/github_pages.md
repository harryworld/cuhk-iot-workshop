## Github Pages

Another way to host static sites is via Github Pages.

### Purposes

This is a very common way nowadays to host a static site. All you need to do is to put into GitHub and they will host the site for you.

### Steps

1. Register `GitHub` account, with your __username__
2. Create a repository under your username, which look like `username.github.io`
3. Download the GitHub GUI tool (Mac / Windows)
4. Click the green "Set up in Desktop" button. When the GitHub desktop app opens, save the project.
5. Copy the content of the theme folder into this new project
6. Enter the repository, commit your changes, and press the sync button
7. Fire up a browser and go to http://username.github.io. Give it a couple of minutes for your page to show upâ€”there will be a delay this very first time.
