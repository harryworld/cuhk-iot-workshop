## Warning: Installation

__Do not__ try to install (Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, etc.) until class starts.

__Bad installs can cause time-consuming problems__.  If youâ€™ve already setup your development environment, we recommend making a backup of your settings.

At the start of the course, we will have time to install and configure your development environment.
