# Installation

**DO NOT** try to install anything else (Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, etc.) until Installfest, as bad installs can cause serious, frustrating, time-consuming problems.  If you’ve already set up your development environment, we recommend making a backup of your settings.

At the start of the class, we will have an “Installfest” to install and configure your development environment (If you don't do it correctly, you may need to start over) while giving you an opportunity to get to know your classmates.
