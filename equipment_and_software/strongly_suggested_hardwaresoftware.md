If you plan on updating your OS at some point over the next few months, be sure to do so before you come to Installfest. It's never a good idea to update your entire system during a class or a major project.

**If you plan on using a PC, we will need to make sure you're running the correct set of Software. Let us know if you plan on taking this route and we can discuss the best way to support you.**
