# Equipment and Software

The prework does not require any specific software or configuration other than a browser, and we designed it that way for a reason. Installing software and setting up your development environment can be one of the most frustrating parts of starting out as a web developer.

Most web developers, including our instructional team, use Macs to do their development. We will be able to provide the best support for you if you also have one.
