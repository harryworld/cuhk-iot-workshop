## Equipment and Software


### Software
This guideline requires minimal software installation. The software that you'll need are freely downloadable and will be introduced to you in a _just-in-time_ manner.

### Hardware
Most web developers use Macs to do their development.

It's not because we are all Apple fanboys. It's just that most of the open source tools are geared towards Macs.

We will be able to provide the best support to you if you also have one.
