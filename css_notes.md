## CSS Notes

### The Grammar of CSS

- Styles define how to dress up HTML elements
- Each style description is made up of a Selector and
Declaration
- Selector defines which HTML element should be used
for display and the declaration defines how
- Each declaration contains propertie-value pairs
- The CSS selectors can be using HTML Tag, ID or Class names
- Style definition should always be placed in an external file (e.g. style.css)
- Inline CSS is **highly NOT** recommended.
