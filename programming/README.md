## Programming Languages

A programming language is a language designed to communicate instructions to a computer.

Last checked, there are 688 programming languages listed on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages). Some are "ancient" languages that are rarely uses anymore. Some are designed for specific tasks.

Among the most popular used in the internet industry today are:

1. Javascript
2. Ruby
3. Python
4. Java
5. PHP

In this prework, we will expose you to _Coffeescript_ (a dialect of Javascript) and _Ruby_. These are two cutting edge programming languages which we will be using in our course.

We chose two languages to give you exposure. It may feel a bit overwhelming at first, but don't worry. We are not expecting you to become masters of either of these languages before the course starts.

The important thing is to expose yourself to the fundamental programming concepts and at least have looked at and got used to typing a few lines of code. That said, do give the upcoming challenges an honest try!

Once the fundamentals programming concepts clicks in your mind, you will be able to pick up new programming languages quickly and on demand.


### Goal

- Learn the basics of _CoffeeScript_ and _Ruby_
- Expose yourself to fundamental programming concepts:
  - variables
  - arrays
  - hashes
  - functions
  - loops
  - conditionals
- Get a feel for the differences between the two languages
