## CoffeeScript

### Purposes

CoffeeScript is a way to write beautiful code, which can be converted into JavaScript.

JavaScript was originally designed so programmers can add basic interactivity to websites that browsers can understand. Today, thanks to [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), developers can write server side code with JavaScript as well.
