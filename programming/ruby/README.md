## Ruby

### Purposes

Ruby is a programming language invented over 20 years ago. It's design philosophy was driven by it's mantra _"a programmer's best friend."_

However, it was not an immediate success. It's fame came after the creation of the Ruby on Rails framework.

The concepts from both Ruby and Ruby on Rails have had a large impact on the internet industry and current design of both computer languages and frameworks.

Our purpose here is for you to sample this beautiful language prior to our Ruby on Rails segment of the WDI course.
