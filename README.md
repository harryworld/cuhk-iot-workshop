# Welcome to WDI

Congratulations on joining _Web Development Immersive (WDI)_. This is the beginning of your journey from being a thinker to becoming a creator.

### Mindset

We believe mindset is very important to your success. So a few words on this.

We think of this course as an apprenticeship program. From this moment on, you are not a student, and we are not your instructors. Rather, you are now a junior web developer and we are your senior developers, mentors and guides.

You get out of the course the effort that you put in.

This prework will expose you to basic topics, so we can hit the ground running when the program starts.
